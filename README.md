# Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Bangladesh) Website Clone

## Project Concept

This is a personal project I have taken on to practice my web development skills. The final aim of the project is to recreate the existing website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh and give it some UI tweaks. MoFA's current website appears dated and fails to represent the country's profile effectively; my goal is to modernise the existing UI. 

## Tech Stack

I am working on the front end and general UI as of now. For that, I have been using the classic HTML/CSS combination. I do plan on integrating core aspects of interactivity once I get to the backend. The backend will certainly include javascript, along with any other API's or frameworks that might prove to be necessary to include.
